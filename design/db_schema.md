# Database Schema Design

## Overview
The database schema is designed to support real-time monitoring, historical analysis, and fault detection in a telecom network.

It separates device inventory, performance metrics, and alert events to ensure scalability and clarity.

## Tables

### Devices
Stores information about telecom network devices.

Fields:
- device_id (PK): Unique identifier for each device
- device_name: Human-readable device name
- device_type: Type of device (router, switch, link)
- ip_address: Device IP address
- device_status: Current operational state (UP/DOWN)

---

### Metrics
Stores time-series performance metrics collected from devices.

Fields:
- metric_id (PK): Unique metric record identifier
- device_id (FK): References Devices(device_id)
- collected_time: Time when metric was collected
- latency_ms: Network latency in milliseconds
- packet_loss_percent: Packet loss percentage
- throughput_mbps: Data throughput in Mbps
- cpu_usage_percent: CPU utilization percentage

---

### Alerts
Stores fault and anomaly events generated by the analysis engine.

Fields:
- alert_id (PK): Unique alert identifier
- device_id (FK): References Devices(device_id)
- alert_type: Type of alert (latency, packet loss, device down)
- severity: INFO / WARNING / CRITICAL
- triggered_time: Time when alert was generated
- description: Detailed alert message
- alert_status: OPEN / ACKNOWLEDGED / RESOLVED

---

## Relationships
- One device can generate multiple metrics over time
- One device can trigger multiple alerts

---

## Performance Considerations
- Indexes on (device_id, collected_time) in Metrics
- Indexes on (device_id, triggered_time) in Alerts
